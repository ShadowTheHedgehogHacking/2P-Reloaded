## About
This project is a combination of the [2P-ShdTH](https://github.com/ShadowTheHedgehogHacking/2P-ShdTH) and [ShdTH-Reloaded](https://github.com/ShadowTheHedgehogHacking/ShdTH-Reloaded) mods with full feature parity.

Experience all the enhancements of the Reloaded project with 2 players in Story Mode, Select Mode, Expert Mode, and Last Story.

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

You must set Dolphin to use 64MB of RAM to play this mod.
If you are playing on Wii/GameCube, you must apply the `console-compatibility-textures` branch, which reduces texture sizes to have mostly stable gameplay with only 24MB of RAM.
